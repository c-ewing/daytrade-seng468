# Dummy Quote server:
Create a dummy quote server that listens on localhost:4444 for debugging locally and not in the lab.

Behaves similarly to the lab quote server however it returns the same crpyokey every time and randomly generates the quote price. Always responses with the calling user and the associated stock symbol.
